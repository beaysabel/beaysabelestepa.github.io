                            <p> Dear Best friend, </p>

                            <p>
                                Hi! How are you? Really? I haven't talked to you for a while now and I never got the chance to say this to you for how many years of friendship so here it goes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I really wanted to thank you. Thank you for everything. Thank you for being my friend. Thank you for cheering me up whenever I’m down. Thank you for helping me boost my confidence whenever I am very insecure about myself. Thank you for comforting me during my first heartbreak. Thank you for helping me get through it. Thank you for always being there for me no matter what. Thank you for showing your never-ending love and care fore me. Thank you for teaching me to put myself first. Thank you for knowing my worth. Thank you for being my shield. Thank you for always saving me. I am really grateful for you.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I miss you a lot. I miss being with you all the time. I miss how you greet me everyday in the bus early in the morning with a big smile on your face. I miss how jolly you are no matter what time of day and how you always cheer me up in times when I am very sad. I miss how you were only one call away.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Always remember that you’re the best thing that’s every happened to me. You’re the kind of person people can’t live without. You’re loving and caring. You’re strong and compassionate. Above all, you’re beautiful. Please don’t ever change. You may change people but don’t let people change you. Don’t let others think less about you because you’re already more of us combined. I hope you know these because you deserve the world. You deserve the best. I love you so much.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Love,
                            </p>
                            One of the many lives you have saved
