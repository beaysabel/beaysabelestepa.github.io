                            <p>
                                Hush now, pretty girl. Stop crying. Look at you, wasting your time over something useless. I know this is not the ending you’ve been waiting and wanting, but this basically means now is not the right time for it. You’re “happy ever after” is yet to come.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Chin up, look strong, and don’t let your head down. Prove to them that you are independent and powerful because you really are. This will not be your love story’s ending. This is just another chapter of one of your heartbreaks. Therefore, a new chapter begins.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Wake up. You don’t need them. You don’t need him. You deserve someone who will love and appreciate you as you are. You deserve someone who will be with you along your walk through life. It is time for you to move onto the new chapter of your story. It’s time for you to be happily writing and cherishing every moment on that new chapter. You must believe that you deserve the best.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Forget about the people who don’t love you. Forget about him. Let them all go. Let go of the people who pull you down, people who aren’t happy for your successes, people who makes you think less about yourself. Make sure that the people you let in deserves you. Make sure he deserves you. Always know your worth.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is the right time to explore and reflect on your past. Learn from it and don’t make the same mistakes again. Enlighten yourself that for the people who will enter our life, you will now know who you won’t let go of and would. So that you won’t fall easily. You will be proud and have that confidence to show who and what you really are.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Let time heal you. Love yourself. Find the good in everything that God gives you. He’s not worth your tears during 12 a.m. thoughts. He doesn’t deserve to be in your world. You never deserved to settle for less.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Time will come when you’ll find them. You’ll find him; the right one. And when that time comes, I know you will be the happiest girl in the whole universe. You’ll gladly end that chapter and would live happily-ever-after.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Sincerely,
                            </p>
                            Someone who believes that you are loved and deserve the best
